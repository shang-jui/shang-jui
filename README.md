  ## Hi, Iâ€™m shang-jui ðŸ‘‹
 I have a lot of passions for coding and playing basketball.
 Everytimes I try hard and made a basket in the game, I think that is the same feeling when I solve the coding problem successfully.
 I always tell myself that "You need to still improve your skills that can give you opportunity to take an unbelievable shoot and swished."
 That's why I love it.
